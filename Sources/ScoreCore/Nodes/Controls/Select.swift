/// A node that renders a drop-down selection control.
///
/// `Select` renders as the HTML `<select>` element, presenting the user with a
/// menu of choices built from ``Option`` and ``OptionGroup`` children. It
/// integrates with HTML forms through its `name` identifier and supports
/// single-choice as well as multi-choice modes.
///
/// Typical uses include:
/// - Choosing a country or region from a predefined list
/// - Selecting one or more categories to filter content
/// - Picking a value from a constrained set inside a form
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Select(name: "country", id: "country-select", required: true) {
///     Option(value: "us") { "United States" }
///     Option(value: "ca") { "Canada" }
///     Option(value: "gb") { "United Kingdom" }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Always pair `Select` with a visible `<label>` element whose
///   `for` attribute matches the select's `id` so that assistive technologies
///   can announce the control correctly.

    /// When `true`, renders the HTML `required` attribute.

/// ### Example

/// ```swift
/// Select(name: "size") {
