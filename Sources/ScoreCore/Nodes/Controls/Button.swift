/// The behavioral type of a button element.
///
/// `ButtonType` maps directly to the HTML `type` attribute of the `<button>`
/// element and controls what the button does when activated inside a form
/// context.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Button(type: .submit) {
///     Text("Submit Form")
/// }
/// ```
public enum ButtonType: String, Sendable {

    /// A generic push button with no default behavior.
    ///
    /// Use `.button` for actions that are handled entirely by JavaScript or by
    /// the Score event system, such as opening a modal or toggling a menu.
    case button

    /// A button that submits the associated form's data to the server.
    ///
    /// When activated, the browser serialises the form fields and sends them to
    /// the URL specified by the form's `action` property using its `method`.
    case submit

    /// A button that resets all fields in the associated form to their initial values.
    ///
    /// Equivalent to the user manually clearing every input; use with caution,
    /// as accidental resets can be frustrating.
    case reset
}

/// A node that renders an interactive button element.
///
/// `Button` renders as the HTML `<button>` element and can contain arbitrary
/// child nodes, making it suitable for icon buttons, text-and-icon combinations,
/// or any other rich content.
///
/// The button's role within a form is determined by its `type`. When `type` is
/// `.submit`, activating the button submits the form identified by `form` (or
/// the closest ancestor `<form>` in the DOM). When `type` is `.reset`, it
/// resets that form's fields.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// // A plain action button
/// Button {
///     Text("Open Menu")
/// }
///
/// // A submit button tied to a specific form by ID
/// Button(type: .submit, form: "login-form") {
///     Text("Sign In")
/// }
///
/// // A disabled reset button
/// Button(type: .reset, disabled: true) {
///     Text("Clear")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Prefer `Button(type: .submit)` over JavaScript-driven submission
///   where possible, as it provides better browser and accessibility support.

    public let value: String?

    ///     to `nil`, which associates the button with its ancestor form.
    ///   - name: The name key submitted with form data. Defaults to `nil`.
    ///   - value: The value submitted alongside `name`. Defaults to `nil`.
    ///   - disabled: Whether the button is disabled and non-interactive.
