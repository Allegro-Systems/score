/// The data type and widget style of an input control.
///
/// `InputType` maps directly to the `type` attribute of the HTML `<input>`
/// element and governs both the kind of data the field accepts and the
/// native browser widget used to collect it.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Input(type: .email, name: "userEmail", placeholder: "you@example.com")
/// Input(type: .date, name: "birthday")
/// Input(type: .checkbox, name: "acceptTerms")
/// ```

    /// Browsers validate the value's format and may present an optimised
    /// keyboard on mobile devices (e.g. showing `@` prominently).
    case email

    /// A field whose value is obscured from view.
    ///
    /// Characters are masked so that bystanders cannot read the value.
    /// Use for passwords and other secrets.
    case password

    /// A field for numeric values.
    ///
    /// Browsers may render increment/decrement spinners and restrict input to
    /// digits, decimal separators, and sign characters.
    case number

    /// A field whose value is not displayed or editable by the user.
    ///
    /// Use to include data in a form submission that the user should not see
    /// or modify, such as CSRF tokens or record identifiers.
    case hidden

    /// A single-line text field styled and semantically marked as a search box.
    ///
    /// Functionally similar to `.text`, but browsers may add a clear button
    /// and search-specific styling.
    case search

    /// A field for telephone numbers.
    ///
    /// No format validation is enforced, but mobile browsers typically present
    /// a numeric/phone keypad layout.
    case tel

    ///
    /// Browsers validate that the value is a well-formed URL and may show a
    /// URL-optimised keyboard on mobile devices.
    case url

    /// A date picker limited to year, month, and day.
    ///
    /// The submitted value is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
    case date

    /// A time picker limited to hours and minutes (and optionally seconds).
    ///
    /// The submitted value is formatted as `HH:MM` or `HH:MM:SS`.

    ///
    /// Requires the enclosing `Form` to use `.multipart` encoding.
    case file

    /// A boolean on/off toggle rendered as a checkbox.
    ///
    /// The field's `value` is submitted only when the checkbox is checked.
    case checkbox

    /// A single-selection control within a group of options sharing the same `name`.
    ///
    /// Only the selected radio button in a group contributes its `value` to
    /// the form submission.
    case radio

    /// A slider control for selecting a numeric value within a range.
    ///
    /// The exact value is not typically displayed to the user. Combine with an
    /// output element if the current value needs to be visible.
    case range

    /// A colour picker that returns a hex colour string (e.g. `#ff0000`).
    case color

    ///
    /// The submitted value is formatted as `YYYY-MM`.
    case month

/// A node that renders a single-field form control.
///
/// `Input` renders as the HTML `<input>` element — a self-closing, void element
/// with no children. The control's visual appearance and accepted data are
/// determined by the `type` property.
///
/// Pair an `Input` with a `Label` that references the input's `id` to satisfy
/// accessibility requirements, ensuring screen readers can announce the field's
/// purpose.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// // A required email field with a placeholder
/// Input(type: .email, name: "email", placeholder: "you@example.com",
///       id: "email-field", required: true)
///
/// // A pre-populated, read-only text field
/// Input(type: .text, name: "username", value: "jdoe", readOnly: true)
///
/// // A hidden field carrying a CSRF token
/// Input(type: .hidden, name: "csrf_token", value: token)
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Always associate visible inputs with a `Label` via the
///   input's `id` to meet accessibility standards.
