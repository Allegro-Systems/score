/// ```swift
/// Form(action: "/login", method: .post) {
///     Input(type: .email, name: "email")
///     Input(type: .password, name: "password")

///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Form(action: "/upload", method: .post, encoding: .multipart) {
///     Input(type: .file, name: "avatar")
///     Button(type: .submit) { Text("Upload") }

    /// Required when the form contains file inputs (`Input(type: .file)`),
    /// because binary file data cannot be percent-encoded efficiently.
    case multipart = "multipart/form-data"

    /// Encodes form data as plain text with minimal encoding.

/// A node that renders an HTML form element for collecting and submitting user input.
///
/// `Form` renders as the HTML `<form>` element and groups one or more input
/// controls together with a submission target. When submitted, the browser
/// serialises the values of all named controls inside the form and sends them
/// to `action` using `method`.
///
/// An optional `id` allows `Button` nodes elsewhere in the document to
/// associate themselves with this form via their `form` property, even when
/// they are not DOM descendants of the form.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Form(action: "/signup", method: .post) {
///     Label(for: "email-input") { Text("Email") }
///     Input(type: .email, name: "email", id: "email-input", required: true)
///     Button(type: .submit) { Text("Create Account") }
/// }
///
/// // File upload form with multipart encoding
/// Form(action: "/upload", method: .post, encoding: .multipart) {
///     Input(type: .file, name: "document")
///     Button(type: .submit) { Text("Upload") }
/// }
/// ```
