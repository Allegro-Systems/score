/// The fundamental building block of a Score UI hierarchy.
///
/// `Node` is the core protocol that all renderable elements conform to. It
/// mirrors the composable tree model found in SwiftUI: each node declares
/// its structure by returning child nodes from its `body` property, and the
/// Score renderer recursively walks that tree to produce output (e.g. HTML).
///
/// Primitive nodes — such as `TextNode`, `TupleNode`, and `EmptyNode` —
/// are terminal nodes whose `body` property is `Never`. These represent
/// actual rendered output rather than further composition.
///
/// ### Conforming to Node
///
/// Implement `body` to describe the node's content using `@NodeBuilder`:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Greeting: Node {
///     let name: String
///
///     var body: some Node {
///         TextNode("Hello, \(name)!")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Primitive Nodes
///
/// Types that produce output directly (rather than composing other nodes)
/// set `Body` to `Never` and should never have their `body` accessed at
/// runtime. Score's renderer identifies these types by their concrete type
/// rather than calling `body`.
///
/// - Note: All conforming types must also conform to `Sendable` so that
///   node trees can be safely passed across concurrency boundaries.
public protocol Node: Sendable {

    /// The type of node that represents the body of this node.
    ///
    /// For composite nodes this is typically an opaque `some Node` type
    /// inferred from the return value of `body`. For primitive nodes —
    /// those that are rendered directly without further composition — this
    /// is `Never`.
    associatedtype Body: Node

    /// The content and structure of this node.
    ///
    /// Score calls this property when traversing the node tree. Do not
    /// call it directly. Primitive node types set `Body` to `Never` and
    /// trap unconditionally if `body` is accessed.
    ///
    /// Use `@NodeBuilder` to compose multiple child nodes in the body:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// var body: some Node {
    ///     HeaderNode()
    ///     ContentNode()
    ///     FooterNode()
    /// }
    /// ```
    @NodeBuilder
    var body: Body { get }
}

/// A node that renders nothing.
///
/// `EmptyNode` is Score's zero-content sentinel. It is produced by
/// `@NodeBuilder` when a builder block contains no statements, and can
/// also be used explicitly to satisfy a `Node` requirement without emitting
/// any output.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ConditionalBanner: Node {
///     let showBanner: Bool
///
///     var body: some Node {
///         if showBanner {
///             BannerNode(text: "Welcome back!")
///         }
///         // EmptyNode is produced automatically when showBanner is false
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Note: `EmptyNode` is a primitive node — its `body` property is `Never`
///   and must never be called directly.
public struct EmptyNode: Node {

    /// The body of `EmptyNode`, which is never accessible at runtime.
    ///
    /// `EmptyNode` is a primitive node. Accessing `body` triggers a fatal
    /// error and is only declared to satisfy the `Node` protocol requirement.
    public var body: Never { fatalError() }

    /// Creates an empty node that produces no rendered output.
    public init() {}
}

/// Conformance that allows `Never` to satisfy the `Node` associated-type
/// constraint used by primitive nodes.
///
/// Primitive nodes (e.g. `TextNode`, `EmptyNode`) declare `Body == Never`
/// to signal that they are rendered directly and do not have a composable
/// body. This extension provides the required `body` property, which traps
/// unconditionally if called — it should never be invoked by the renderer.
extension Never: Node {

    /// Accessing this property is a programming error and always traps.
    ///
    /// `Never` exists solely to satisfy the `Body` associated-type
    /// requirement for primitive nodes. The Score renderer identifies
    /// primitive nodes by their concrete type and never calls `body` on them.
    public var body: Never { fatalError() }

///
/// `TextNode` is a primitive leaf node that emits text content into the

/// `@NodeBuilder` automatically lifts `String` literals into `TextNode`
/// values, so you rarely need to construct one explicitly:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Label: Node {
///     var body: some Node {
///         "Hello, world!"   // Becomes TextNode("Hello, world!")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let node = TextNode("Score makes UI composition easy.")
/// ```
///
/// - Note: `TextNode` is a primitive node — its `body` property is `Never`
///   and must never be called directly.

    /// The raw string content that will be emitted into the rendered output.
    ///
    /// This value is passed verbatim to the renderer. Escaping or encoding
    /// (e.g. HTML entity encoding) is the responsibility of the renderer,
    /// not this type.
