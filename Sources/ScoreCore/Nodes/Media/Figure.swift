/// A node that groups self-contained media content with an optional caption.

/// `Figure` renders as the HTML `<figure>` element. It is intended to wrap
/// content that is referenced from the main document flow but could be moved
/// to a different position without affecting that flow — such as images,
/// illustrations, diagrams, code listings, or tables.
///
/// Pair `Figure` with `FigureCaption` to provide a visible caption that is
/// semantically associated with the grouped content.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Figure {
///     Image(src: "/images/architecture.png", alt: "System architecture diagram")
///     FigureCaption {
///         Text("Figure 1 — High-level system architecture.")
///     }
/// }
/// ```

///
/// `FigureCaption` renders as the HTML `<figcaption>` element. It must be placed
/// as a direct child of a `Figure` node, either as its first or last child.
/// The browser and assistive technologies use this element to associate the
/// caption text with the surrounding figure.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Figure {
///     Image(src: "/photos/team.jpg", alt: "The engineering team")
///     FigureCaption {
///         Text("The core engineering team at our 2025 offsite.")
