/// Strategies for loading an image relative to the viewport.
///
/// `ImageLoading` maps directly to the HTML `loading` attribute on the
/// `<img>` element, giving the browser a hint about when to fetch the
/// image resource.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Image(src: "hero.jpg", alt: "Hero banner", loading: .lazy)
/// ```
public enum ImageLoading: String, Sendable {

    /// Fetches the image immediately, regardless of viewport visibility.
    ///
    /// Use this for above-the-fold images that must be available as soon as
    /// the page loads. Equivalent to the HTML `loading="eager"` attribute.
    case eager

    /// Defers fetching the image until it is near the viewport.
    ///
    /// Prefer `.lazy` for below-the-fold images to reduce initial page load
    /// time and save bandwidth on pages with many images. Equivalent to the
    /// HTML `loading="lazy"` attribute.
    case lazy
}

/// The decoding strategy the browser should use when processing an image.
///
/// `ImageDecoding` maps to the HTML `decoding` attribute on the `<img>`
/// element, allowing you to hint whether image decoding should block
/// presentation of other content.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// Image(src: "diagram.png", alt: "System diagram", decoding: .async)
/// ```
public enum ImageDecoding: String, Sendable {

    /// Decodes the image synchronously before presenting subsequent content.
    ///
    /// This is the traditional behaviour and may cause a brief delay in
    /// rendering content that follows the image. Equivalent to
    /// `decoding="sync"`.
    case sync

    /// Decodes the image asynchronously, allowing other content to render
    /// without waiting.
    ///
    /// Use `.async` for large images where decoding latency would otherwise
    /// degrade perceived rendering speed. Equivalent to `decoding="async"`.
    case async

    /// Lets the browser choose the decoding strategy for the current context.
    ///
    /// This is the default browser behaviour when no `decoding` attribute is
    /// present. Equivalent to `decoding="auto"`.
    case auto
}

/// A node that embeds an image into the document.
///
/// `Image` renders as the HTML `<img>` element. It requires both a source URL
/// and an alternative text description. Providing accurate `alt` text is
/// essential for accessibility and for situations where the image cannot be
/// loaded.
///
/// You can optionally specify intrinsic dimensions, a loading strategy, and a
/// decoding hint. Use the `localized` initialiser when the image source should
/// be resolved through the package's localisation system.
///
/// Typical uses include:
/// - Displaying photos, illustrations, and diagrams
/// - Serving responsive images via a parent `Picture` element
/// - Providing a fallback image inside a `Figure`
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// // Basic image
/// Image(src: "/images/logo.png", alt: "Company logo")
///
/// // Image with explicit dimensions and lazy loading
/// Image(
///     src: "/images/banner.jpg",
///     alt: "Promotional banner",
///     width: 1200,
///     height: 400,
///     loading: .lazy,
///     decoding: .async
/// )
///
/// // Localised image whose path is resolved from a resource bundle
/// Image(localized: "hero-image", alt: "Hero illustration")
/// ```
///
/// - Important: Always supply meaningful `alt` text. An empty string is only
///   appropriate for purely decorative images that convey no information.
public struct Image: Node {
