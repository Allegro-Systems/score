/// A protocol that represents the root configuration of a Score application.
///
/// `Application` is the top-level entry point that wires together the page
/// hierarchy, controller routing table, theme contract, and metadata contract
/// for a Score server. At startup the runtime inspects `pages`, `controllers`,
/// `theme`, and `metadata` to construct rendering and request pipelines.
///
/// Typical uses include:
/// - Declaring every `Page` the server should render
/// - Registering `Controller` types that handle API or form endpoints
/// - Defining a global `Theme` used during CSS and design-token emission
/// - Defining default `Metadata` inherited by all pages
/// - Serving as the single source of truth for application structure
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// struct MyApp: Application {
///     var pages: [any Page] {
///         [
///             HomePage(),
///             AboutPage(),
///             ContactPage(),
///         ]
///     }
///
///     var theme: (any Theme)? { MyTheme(name: "default") }
///
///     var metadata: (any Metadata)? { AppMetadata(title: "My App") }
///
///     var controllers: [any Controller] {
///         [
///             UserController(),
///             PostController(),
///         ]
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// Pages are evaluated in the order they appear in this collection.
    var pages: [any Page] { get }

    /// The active application theme used for rendering.

    /// server's routing table at startup.
    var controllers: [any Controller] { get }

    /// The active application theme used for rendering.

    /// The default document metadata inherited by pages.
    ///
    /// The default implementation returns `nil`, meaning pages start with no

    public var metadata: (any Metadata)? { nil }
