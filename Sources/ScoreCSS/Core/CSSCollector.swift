/// Collects CSS declarations from a node tree and deduplicates identical
/// rule sets to produce minimal output.
///
/// `CSSCollector` walks a node tree, extracts modifier values from
/// `ModifiedNode` instances, converts them to CSS declarations via
/// `CSSEmitter`, and groups the results by a content-derived scope
/// identifier. When two nodes produce identical declaration sets, they
/// share the same scope class, eliminating duplicate CSS.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// var collector = CSSCollector()
/// collector.collect(from: myNodeTree)
/// let css = collector.renderStylesheet()
/// ```
///
/// ### Scope Deduplication
///
/// Each unique set of declarations is assigned a deterministic class name
/// derived from a hash of the sorted declarations. Nodes that happen to
/// produce the same CSS share the same class, keeping the stylesheet
/// compact.
